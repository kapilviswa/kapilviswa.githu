		<p>Ramweb is the official management portal of Colorado State University, Fort collins. It provides the platform for all the students and faculties to check their up-to-date status based on their roles at Colostate. However, the user experience of the website is unsatisfactory for its poor information hierarchy, interaction and visual communication.
		</p>
		<p>Many students have difficulty using class schedule information via the MyCUInfo portal.
		Problems include:
		<ol>
		<li>Findability — schedule is lumped with other account information</li>
		<li>Portability — not easily viewed on smart phones, requires zooming and scrolling</li>
		<li>Usability — gaps in schedule, which are useful for study and work time planning, are not shown</li>
		<li>Convenience — there is no easy way to share and re-use schedule data</li>
		<li>Engagement — design feels “old” and outdated</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
		<li>Help students retrieve their class schedules, including days, times and locations</li>
		<li>Seamlessly integrate class events into the student’s preferred calendar</li>
		<li>Provide a user interface that is familiar, easily navigable and engaging</li>
		<li>Improve ease-of-use</li>
		<li>Support mobile devices</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>User Research</h2>
		<p>The stakeholders includes students, faculties, school operations administrators. However, the website’s operating side might be different from the end-user’s side. Only the end users, students and faculties, will be focused for this design solutions. Among all groups of the end users, the target users would be the mainstream students at school.
		</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/illustration-1.svg" alt=""></figure>
		<p>In order to deeply learn users’ demands about this management portal, interview is considered as the best method for the research. After the screening phase, two semi structured interview has been arranged. During the interview, participants talked about their experience of using ramweb as a part of their routine. They were also asked to achieve the tasks during the interview and shared their opinions toward the website.
		</p>
		<p>Not surprisingly, some students invented their own workflows to avoid frustration and
		overcome MyCUInfo usability issues. Some entered classes into calendaring apps (strictly a copy
		and paste operation), while others took creative routes.</p>

		<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
		<p>There is too much information showed at the same time which makes users harder to find their target. The structure of the website is not clear so that it’s very hard for users to find certain information. Some functions are rarely used even though they are located in the relatively important place of the website.
		</p>

		<h2>Visual Design</h2>
		<p>The color scheme of the website is out of date and more modern and fresh design is desired. The information lacks hierarchy that makes the user experience worse. No animation for providing the visual clue for users during the interaction.
		</p>

		<h2>Brainstorm, Sketches and Prioritization</h2>
		<p>The usability problems have been found from the pilot design research and interviews. Design questions is scoped based on the findings. Then, the initial ideas are developed during the brainstorming and ideation phases.
		</p>
		<figure class="browser-screenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/ideate-1.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
		<p>The paper prototype shows the general structure and interaction model of the dashboard with some key interactable information. The modification and improvement are include: Student’s profile has been shown on the dashboard; The main menu bar has been reorganized and simplified; Quick Registration Information button has been added to the dashboard.</p>
		<figure class="browser-screenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/paper-proto.png" alt=""></figure>
		<p>Since the paper prototype is a quick and dirty draft of the potential proposal, it gave the participant more chances to talk about their thought and concern during the test and some of them are very valuable for the next step: Visualized information is better than dry words; Less information will be more efficient for users; Card method is an effect way for display; A dashboard is a good way to show multiple important information; A straightforward navigation bar is needed.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>At the first round of iteration, many detailed interaction and display methods have been developed. From macro to micro, the design at this phase is more focus on the interaction approaches at a relatively detailed level after modifying the information architecture of the website.
		</p>
		<div class="two-up">
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/wireframe-1.png" alt=""></figure>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/wireframe-2.png" alt=""></figure>

		<p>Since the paper prototype is a quick and dirty draft of the potential proposal, it gave the participant more chances to talk about their thought and concern during the test and some of them are very valuable for the next step: Visualized information is better than dry words; Less information will be more efficient for users; Card method is an effect way for display; A dashboard is a good way to show multiple important information; A straightforward navigation bar is needed.</p>

		<h2>Low-Fi Prototype</h2>
		<p>he Favorite Courses works as the shopping cart especially when users are doing course shopping before the registration. This feature is added to increase the efficiency of course shopping. The program’s mandatory courses will be shown automatically. At the same time, the departments or the program administrators also have the rights to recommend courses for students via this way</p>
		<figure class="browser-screenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/low-fi.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Usability study</h2>
		<p>We recruited six students, with varied backgrounds ranging from an undeclared freshman to a
		computer science major. Using the low-fi interactive prototype, we asked open-ended
		questions, such as “what is the purpose of this page?”, and “how and when would you use it?”</p>
		<p>We observed the students completing tasks. For example:
			<ul>
				<li>Find directions to your Sociology class starting at 8:00 am</li>
				<li>Find your Sociology class</li>
				<li>Share your schedule</li>
				<li>Hide the schedule</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Students wanted a weekly view akin to a planner,
		with shading of the classes to easily tell them apart. We learned the students “hire” their
		schedule for the first two weeks of the semester. For a given day, show me my courses, start
		times, and where I need to be - buildings.
		Once memorized, they rarely looked up their schedule. If the design mimicked the still-popular
		flashcard format, students could easily learn their schedule by heart.
		The grid layout for the schedule naturally stretches to the edges of the screen, filling the space
		with just the right amount of information. Class details like maps, room numbers, instructor and
		so on are easily viewed by tapping on the squares in the grid. Gaps between classes are clearly
		visible, to plan travel times, study breaks, and so on.
		</p>

		<h2>Design Iteration and development</h2>
		<p>According to the feedback and the usability problems, the design will be iterated for the second round. At the same time, the GUI will be developed at the same time.</p>
		<figure class="browser-screenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/4-Colostate/brand.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>High fidelity Prototype</h2>
		<p>
			At the second round of iteration, detailed graphic interaction elements are defined. Also, feedbacks of the user tests are considered when making the design decision. The improvements include:
			<ul>
				<li>Polished the login page.</li>
				<li>Monochromatic color scheme to keep the consistency.</li>
				<li>Important dates are marked in the calendar.</li>
				<li>Icons and feedbacks are designed to visualize the interaction.</li>
				<li>Highlighted the Favorite Courses section by showing it at the focus point.</li>
				<li>Filter has been simplified.</li>
				<li>Transition and Animation are used to provide the interaction clues.</li>
				<li>Identification has been added.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The High-fi prototype was not attached here due to confidentiality.</p>
		</p>

		<h2>Outcomes</h2>
		<p>With three rounds of usability testing from the very low fidelity prototypes to the high fidelity ones, the design has been developed and iterated almost at the same time. I found this is a very effective way to develop a contextual design in a very convincing way. By following the macro-to-micro mechanism, every version of the prototypes focuses on demonstrating certain ideas while every round of tests provides the feedbacks for the present idea with the new questions and demands raised for the next stage.</p>
